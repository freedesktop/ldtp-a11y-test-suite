This package does not provide installable scripts. The scripts must be run
from within the scripts directory proper.

To install the python module(s) that these scripts use, however, you will
need to do the following:

     # ./configure
     # make
     # make install

This will install the python module(s) for use by the system. You may also
select a different prefix to install to, by passing the --prefix option to
the configure script.
